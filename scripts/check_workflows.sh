# Validate the GitHub Actions workflow files with actionlint.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-15 a single wrong character in ci.yml -- a double
# quote inside a `${{ }}` expression, where workflow expressions accept only
# single quotes -- made the file invalid. GitHub answers an invalid workflow
# with a failed run NAMED AFTER THE FILE: no annotation, no job, and no checks
# reported at all. `gh pr checks` said "no checks reported on the branch",
# which is indistinguishable from "CI has not started yet", and PR #408 sat for
# an hour looking like it was still building. actionlint names it exactly:
#
#   got unexpected character '"' while lexing expression [...] only single
#   quotes are available for string delimiter
#
# The failure mode is what justifies a dedicated gate. Most CI mistakes announce
# themselves as a red check; this one announces itself as silence, and silence
# is what a broken pipeline and a slow pipeline have in common.
#
# THIS IS NOT A CI GATE, and cannot usefully be one: a workflow too invalid to
# parse is also too invalid to run the job that would have checked it. It has to
# fire before the file reaches GitHub. Three callers do that:
#
#   .claude/settings.json   PostToolUse, on every agent edit  (--hook)
#   scripts/gates.sh        the pre-push gate list
#   .git/hooks/pre-push     if installed; hooks are not versioned
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check_workflows.sh          lint every workflow file
#   scripts/check_workflows.sh --hook   hook JSON on stdin; no-op off-target
#
# Exit codes follow scripts/check_mathlib_style.py: 2 under --hook so the
# PostToolUse hook blocks and the agent fixes it before moving on, 1 otherwise.
