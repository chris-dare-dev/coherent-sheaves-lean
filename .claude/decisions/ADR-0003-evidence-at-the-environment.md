# ADR-0003 — Elaboration and axiom evidence is produced only where the environment lives

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-04
- **Deciders:** Chris Dare
- **Evidence:** `.claude/notes/2026-08-04-arxmcp-lean-integration-audit.md` §2

## Context

arXMCP has a `lean_verify` tool. It is not a stub — 1459 lines over a 483-line
REPL harness, the largest handler in that repo. The tempting design is to let it
produce the contract's elaboration and axiom evidence. The audit found four
reasons that would be unsound, and one of them is a demonstrated exploit.

**1. Wrong environment.** Its REPL is Lean v4.31.0; this repo pins v4.29.0. No
`lean-toolchain`, lakefile, or repl commit is pinned anywhere in arXMCP, and no
result carries library identity — a grep for `mathlib_rev|toolchain|lean_version`
over `server/` returns 4 hits, all comments and error strings.

**2. Demonstrated fail-open.** The declaration-name extractor
(`_DECL_SITE_RE` / `_DECL_NAME_RE`, `server/handlers/lean_verify.py:445-456`)
matches neither sites nor names for the legal single-line forms:

```lean
set_option maxHeartbeats 400000 in theorem sneaky : False := bad
open Classical in theorem sneaky : False := bad
```

The verifying agent **executed the regexes** and reproduced `(['good'], True)`:
`complete` stays `True`, `sneaky` is never `#print axioms`-ed, and the record
emits `outcome: "clean"`.

**3. `status: "ok"` is not a trust verdict**, by arXMCP's own admission —
`.claude/roadmap-briefs/R3-verification-contract.md:4-12`: *"the current surface
can be made to say `ok` to an `axiom`-backed proof."* The rename to
`elaborated_no_errors` is queued and not shipped.

**4. Source-parsing is the wrong mechanism.** Any regex over Lean source is a
race against Lean's grammar, which the grammar wins.

## Decision

**All elaboration and axiom evidence is produced by this repo, in this repo's
pinned environment, by sweeping the kernel's own data structures.**

`lake exe mfc-emit` walks `Environment.constants` and calls
`Lean.collectAxioms`. **It never parses source.** The `set_option … in` evasion
above is therefore not merely caught but structurally impossible on the
producing side — there is no text for it to hide in.

**arXMCP is forbidden by construction from producing this evidence.** Every axis
record carries an `env_digest`. Any axis whose `env_digest` differs from the
record's environment renders **`not_applicable`** — never `pass`, never `fail`.
That converts the v4.31-vs-v4.29 skew from a silent soundness hole into a value
in the type system. `lean_verify` output is admissible only under a reserved
predicate type that satisfies **zero** axes.

`env_digest = sha256(canonical_json({lean_toolchain, lean_githash, resolved
leanOptions, sorted [(name, rev)]}))` — hashing `rev`, never `inputRev` (nine
packages in the manifest carry `inputRev: "main"`), and including
`[leanOptions] autoImplicit = false` because it is elaboration-affecting.

## Consequences

**The shared axiom allowlist becomes the contract's one pre-existing
touchpoint.** `AXIOM_ALLOWLIST = frozenset({"propext", "Quot.sound",
"Classical.choice"})` at `lean_verify.py:397-399` is **byte-identical** to what
`formalization.yaml:82-90` claims for every audited declaration in this repo.
That agreement is now load-bearing and should be pinned by a fixture on both
sides rather than left as a coincidence.

**Two emitter defects must be fixed before the reproducibility gate can pass.**
The ground-phase probe found `collectAxioms` output is **unsorted** —
`["propext","Quot.sound","Classical.choice"]` on one declaration and
`["Quot.sound","propext","Classical.choice"]` on the next. Sort every emitted
array. And emission must be **module-scoped** to the topic's `lean_lib`, not
name-prefix-scoped, or a declaration outside the prefix escapes the sweep.

**`lake env lean scripts/Audit.lean` is not a gate and cannot become one.** It
exits 0 even when `#print axioms` prints `[sorryAx]`, its output is unstructured
prose that wraps unpredictably (2 of 42 entries wrapped over three lines), and
`scripts/` is covered by no `lean_lib` so `lake build` never builds it. The
emitter replaces it; the script's own header already admits it can rot.

**arXMCP still needs its `lean_verify` repaired** — not because the contract
depends on it, but because it is on the same wire an agent reads. Today an agent
can get `outcome: "clean"` on a sorry-backed proof from the tool sitting next to
the honest record. Tracked as a cross-repo epic.

## Amendment, 2026-08-04 — `--restate-check` is in v1.0 scope

Spike #27 asked whether `elabTerm`/`isDefEq` are usable at the v4.29.0 pin,
because `--restate-check` was deferred to v1.1 on that uncertainty alone. They
are, and it is promoted. **Supersedes #54** ("a Mathlib or anchor bump
invalidates 100% of human review at once"), whose recovery cost was the entire
original review budget, per bump.

Measured over **400 Lean-core theorems carrying instance-implicit binders**
(pretty-print the type, re-parse it, re-elaborate it in a fresh context,
`isDefEq` against the original):

| | count |
|---|---|
| round-tripped defeq | 339 |
| failed | 61 |
| of the 339 that passed, how many had elided pp | **0** |
| of the 61 that failed, how many had elided pp | **61** |

Parse failures: 0. Elaboration failures: 0. The correlation is exact, and it
identifies the cause: **pretty-printer elision, and nothing else.** On
statements free of `⋯`, the round trip is 339/339.

**This makes lint rule `E-07` load-bearing for a second reason.** It was written
to stop two different statements hashing identically. It happens to select
exactly the set of statements that cannot be re-elaborated, so it is already the
precondition `--restate-check` needs and no new gate is required. An emission
that passes E-07 is an emission whose statements can be restated.

Three implementation requirements, all found empirically:

1. **`pp.explicit := true` is required**, and it is *not* what the emitter
   stores. Under the emitter's `pp.explicit := false`, 5 of 76 declarations fail
   to elaborate with unresolved metavariables; with implicits printed, 0. So
   `review/1.0` needs its own `reviewed_statement_pp` under explicit options —
   `type_pp` from `emission/1.0` is not sufficient, and reusing it would make
   the check fail on statements that are perfectly fine. **The confirmation
   below shows this requirement is stronger than the proxy revealed.**
2. **The elaboration must be message-log sandboxed.** `elabTerm` *logs* errors
   rather than throwing them, so a `try`/`catch` alone returns success while the
   errors leak into the enclosing build. Snapshot `Core.State.messages`, treat
   `hasErrors` as failure, restore afterwards. Without this the check is
   both wrong and noisy — the failure mode this ADR exists to prevent, arriving
   through the mitigation.
3. **Transparency is not the lever.** `withTransparency .all` rescues exactly
   zero cases — 339 both ways. Do not spend time there.

**What this evidence is not.** The sample is Lean core `Std`, not Mathlib and
not the anchor. These are genuinely typeclass-heavy statements, so it is a
strong proxy, but the anchor was not built on the machine that ran the spike and
the real corpus is untested. It is also the first 400 declarations in iteration
order, not a random sample. Confirm on this repo's own statements before the
first human review is recorded against a restate-check.

### Confirmation, 2026-08-04 (later) — the proxy held, and it understated one requirement

The caveat above is discharged. The anchor was built on this machine and the
identical experiment re-run against the real corpus.

| population | sampled | defeq | NOT-defeq | elab-fail | **E-07-clean subset** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BridgelandStabLean`, `pp.explicit = false` *(what the emitter stores)* | 109 | 95 | **3** | 11 | 95/106 |
| `BridgelandStabLean`, `pp.explicit = true` | 109 | 101 | 0 | 8 | **98/98** |
| `BridgelandStability` (anchor), `pp.explicit = true` | 400 | 304 | 0 | 96 | **293/293** |

Parse failures: 0 in every population. **E-07-clean implies round-trips, with
zero exceptions** — 98/98 here, 293/293 on the anchor, against 339/339 on the
`Std` proxy. The anchor's statements carry the `[Category C]`,
`[Preadditive C]`, `[IsTriangulated C]` stacks that core `Std` never exercises,
which is the case the proxy was standing in for. It stood.

**Requirement 1 is load-bearing in a way the proxy could not show.** On `Std`,
`pp.explicit := false` cost 5 *elaboration failures* — annoying, but detectable,
and they would surface honestly as `not_checkable`. On this repo it produces
**3 `NOT-defeq` results that carry no elision marker**, e.g.
`Lattice.eq_zero_of_two_zsmul_eq_zero`. `E-07` does not flag those, so a
restate-check reading `type_pp` would report **`changed` for a statement that
never changed** — a spurious invalidation of exactly the human review this
mitigation exists to protect. Under `pp.explicit := true`, `NOT-defeq` is **0**
in both populations. Recording `reviewed_statement_pp` under explicit options is
therefore not an optimization; it is the difference between a check that can
silently lie and one that cannot.

**`E-07` over-predicts failure, in the safe direction.** On `Std` the
correlation was exact — no elided statement round-tripped. Here 14 elided
statements did (3 in this repo, 11 in the anchor). So the rule excludes some
checkable statements and admits no uncheckable one, which is the right
direction, but it is a conservative filter rather than a precise one.

**The coverage limit that follows, and it should be stated before anyone
budgets review against it.** ~90% of this repo's statements are E-07-clean
(98 of 109); on the anchor it is **~73%** (293 of 400 — 107 elided). Roughly a
quarter of anchor-style statements are not restate-checkable at all, and for
those a Mathlib or anchor bump still costs a full re-review. `--restate-check`
shrinks #54's blast radius; it does not remove it, and a served record must not
imply otherwise.
