# ADR-0007 — Where the contract package lives

- **Status:** **REOPENED 2026-08-04 (later).** Was "accepted — Option B,
  `arXMCP/contract/`". The evidence the acceptance rested on cannot be found;
  see the amendment at the foot of this file. The decision is **not** replaced
  by a new one here — it is withdrawn pending a re-decision, and no code has
  been written against it.

## Decision

The contract's schemas, fixtures, and CLI live in **`arXMCP/contract/`**, and
topic repos **vendor pinned copies** with a checksum-drift test.

The third repo (`math-research-orchestrator`) is **not** created now. It is
created when the ecosystem's own recorded trigger fires — see "When this
reverses", which is a real dated condition, not an aspiration.

## Why the first recommendation was wrong

The first draft of this ADR recommended a third repo, on the ground that a
conformance fixture corpus cannot referee two implementations from inside one
of them. It cited the recorded verdict as *"NOT NOW — create on trigger"* and
argued for overriding it.

Reading the verdict in full — `_pipeline/stage-1-discovery/synthesis/target-architecture.md`
**§4.2** (note: `_pipeline/` is at the *Source Code* root, **not** inside
arXMCP; the audit's path was wrong) — dissolves the argument three ways:

1. **The referee argument is thin here, because there is only one
   implementation.** The Bowtie / JSON-Schema-Test-Suite model works because
   ~20 independent implementations run the corpus. `mfc` was designed to run on
   both sides, which the red team already flagged (gap 16) as removing the
   check the corpus exists to provide. A corpus cannot referee one
   implementation from anywhere. The fix is gap 16's — hand-computed expected
   digests checked into the fixtures — and it works regardless of location.
2. **The drift problem already has a working, precedented solution in this
   ecosystem.** §4.1: `personal-website` vendors pinned copies of the bridge
   contracts under `.claude/references/bridge/<major>/` **with a checksum-drift
   test**, mirroring the `EXPECTED_TOOL_SCHEMA_SHA256` idiom. That is the
   practical failure — producer silently changes the contract — and it is
   solved without a third repo.
3. **The verdict already considered and rejected this exact argument, as to
   timing.** Verbatim: *"starting it as an arXMCP `.claude/` pipeline with
   envelope-wrapped outputs costs nothing to move later (prompts + scripts
   relocate cheaply), whereas standing up the repo first pays the
   third-constitution tax before any code exists."* With N=1 adopter that
   reasoning holds exactly.

The override was argued from the audit's one-line summary of §4.2. The full
section is a four-trigger decision procedure with a documented losing option,
not a preference. **Do not override a recorded verdict from a summary of it.**

## The larger finding: there is already a bridge contract, and this must join it

§5 of the same document specifies a versioned bridge-contract system that this
design independently re-derived. Composing with it is not optional politeness;
duplicating it would be the failure mode this whole track exists to prevent.

- **§5.1 — "Written-artifact contracts over live coupling … The bridge never
  crosses the network."** This is ADR-0001's cold seam, already adopted
  ecosystem-wide. ADR-0001 is *conformance*, not innovation.
- **§5.2 — a common envelope** every bridge artifact carries:
  `bridge.{artifact, version, producer, produced_at, substrate{server,
  corpus_version, notebook{slug,uri}, filter_echo, retrieval_mode,
  tool_schema_sha256}}` + `payload`. **Our artifacts must use this envelope**,
  not a parallel one.
- **§5.3 — an artifact-type registry that already contains our artifacts.**
  `verdict-record` is *"lean_verify wrapper / panel agents → domain-tagged
  verdict, per-domain vocabulary, **statement hash, toolchain/env versions**"*
  — substantially the attestation bundle. `notebook-ref` already carries the
  `corpus_version` pin. Register new types there; do not mint a private
  namespace.
- **§5.4 rule 7 — "no shared Python package imported by both repos."** This
  **kills `mfc`-as-shared-dependency** as designed. Each side validates with
  its own machinery against vendored schemas.
- **§5.4 rule 4 — registry + handshake:** `GET /bridge/contracts` → type→version
  map + schema SHA-256s, with vendored pins compared in a preflight that halts
  on mismatch. That is where a topic repo checks it is pinned to a live
  contract version.
- **§5.4 rule 6 — verdict vocabularies do not unify.** SP2 measured exactly
  `["VERIFIED"]` overlap across pipelines. Our seven axes are the
  *formalization-domain* vocabulary, not a global enum — which is also
  ADR-0005 restated.

## Consequences

**Good.** No third constitution, no third `.claude/` world, no new pin for a
solo operator. The contract inherits an existing versioning discipline,
handshake endpoint, and vendoring precedent rather than inventing three.
ADR-0001 through ADR-0006 are unaffected — every one of them is about *what*
the contract says, and none about where the schemas are committed.

**Costs, accepted.**

- **Adopter #2 needs commit rights on arXMCP, or a fork, to add fixtures about
  their own topic.** This is the real price. It is also precisely the condition
  that fires the third-repo trigger, so it is self-limiting rather than
  permanent.
- **The fixture corpus lives inside one of the implementations it referees.**
  Compensating rule, adopted: the corpus is **append-only and PR-gated**, and
  arXMCP CI may not modify a fixture in the same commit as a behaviour change.
  Plus gap 16's hand-computed digests, which pin canonicalization by data.
- **`mfc` is no longer a shared package.** It ships as an arXMCP-side CLI. The
  topic repo's half is its Lean emitter plus schema validation against vendored
  copies — no cross-repo Python import.

**Unaffected.** The `@[cites]` attribute and the Lean emitter library are a
*Lean* dependency, not a Python one, so §5.4 rule 7 does not reach them. Where
that Lake package lives is a separate question — see `open-questions.md` Q3,
still open.

## When this reverses

§4.2 names four triggers. **Trigger 3 — "bridge contracts gain consumers
outside the two repos" — is the one that governs here**, and it fires when a
*second topic repo* adopts the contract.

That is the same event as the M3 generalization gate (GitHub #56). So the
sequencing is settled rather than judged: build in `arXMCP/contract/` now; when
adopter #2 is real, the trigger has fired and contracts move to
`math-research-orchestrator`, which §4.2 says *"on creation takes contracts
custody (both repos then vendor)"* — the vendoring pattern is already what we
are doing, so the move is a path change, not a redesign.

Note `bridgeland-stab-lean` is arguably already a consumer outside "the two
repos" (arXMCP + personal-website), so trigger 3 is defensibly already met. It
is not being called met, on the same timing logic the verdict used: one
consumer does not need a registry to be shared.

---

## Amendment, 2026-08-04 (later) — the cited verdict does not exist

Everything above that positively places the contract package in
`arXMCP/contract/` cites one document:

```
_pipeline/stage-1-discovery/synthesis/target-architecture.md
```

**It does not exist.** Searched, in this order, before writing this:

| where | result |
|---|---|
| `arXMCP/_pipeline/` | no such directory |
| `find ~/Personal/SourceCode -name "target-architecture*"` | no hits |
| arXMCP git history, all branches, `--diff-filter=A` | never added |
| `personal-website/.claude/references/bridge/` | **does not exist** |
| `artifact-type registry`, `bridge/contracts`, `bridge envelope` in arXMCP or personal-website | zero hits |

The last two rows matter as much as the first: §4.1's vendoring precedent and
§5.4 rule 4's handshake are cited as *things that already work in this
ecosystem*, and neither is present in the repo said to implement them.

### Independent contradiction, from the artifacts themselves

§5.2 asserts our artifacts "must use this envelope" —
`bridge.{artifact, version, producer, …} + payload`. **None of the seven filled
instances in `2026-08-04-contract-schemas.md` do.** Every one — `emission`,
`environment`, `declarations`, `review`, `build`, `bundle`, `resolution` — has
`schema_version` as its flat first top-level key, with no wrapper.

So this is not only "the citation is unverifiable". The design and the envelope
it is said to conform to already disagree, and nobody noticed, because the
envelope was never read — only quoted.

### What survives, and what does not

| ADR-0007 argument | status |
|---|---|
| 1 — the referee argument is thin, because there is only **one** implementation of `mfc`; a corpus cannot referee one implementation from anywhere, and gap 16's hand-computed digests fix it wherever it lives | **SURVIVES.** Wholly independent of the missing document. |
| 2 — the drift problem has a precedented fix: `personal-website` vendors bridge contracts with a checksum-drift test | **FALSIFIED**, twice: the citing document is absent, and the cited directory does not exist in `personal-website`. |
| 3 — the recorded verdict already rejected this argument on timing | **UNVERIFIABLE.** The verdict cannot be read. |
| §5.1–§5.4 — "there is already a bridge contract and this must join it", including **rule 7**, which is what made `mfc` an arXMCP-side CLI | **UNVERIFIABLE**, and contradicted by the artifacts above. |
| "When this reverses" — §4.2's four triggers, incl. trigger 3 | **UNVERIFIABLE.** The reversal condition cannot be checked, so the decision had no working exit. |

Exactly one argument survives, and it is a negative one: it weakens the *third
repo's* stated justification. **Nothing that positively placed the schemas in
`arXMCP/contract/` survives.** In particular rule 7 is gone, so there is no
longer a reason `mfc` must be arXMCP-side rather than shared.

### The irony worth keeping

This ADR's own closing line in that section reads: **"Do not override a
recorded verdict from a summary of it."** The correction it was making was
real. But the verdict it deferred to could not be read then either — the ADR
quotes it, and the quotes are all we have. The rule was right; its application
consumed the same second-hand evidence it warned against.

### The question has also changed under it

Q2 was framed "third repo (`math-formal-contract`), or `arXMCP/contract/`?" —
on the premise that no third repo existed. **One does now.**
`math-formal-contract-lean` was created hours later by
[`ADR-0008`](ADR-0008-cites-is-a-shared-lake-dependency.md), for an adjacent
reason (the `@[cites]` extension could not be vendored), and it already has CI,
a released attribute and the emitter. ADR-0008 also declined to put that
package in `arXMCP/contract/`, because a Lake `require` on arXMCP would
falsify arXMCP `CLAUDE.md` §4.10's *"Sibling, never a subdirectory, never a
dependency."*

So ADR-0007 and ADR-0008 already point in opposite directions, and ADR-0008 is
the one whose evidence can be checked.

### Status of the work

**No code was written against ADR-0007.** The `arXMCP/contract/` package does
not exist; the milestone that would have created it stopped at
`research-complete` when this was found. That is the only reason this is a
withdrawal rather than a migration.

### What this does not decide

Where the schemas go instead. That is Q2 reopened, and it is an owner call —
see `open-questions.md`.
