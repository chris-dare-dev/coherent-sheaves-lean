# Module sheaves on a variety are `k`-linear

On a variety over `k`, multiplication by a global function is an endomorphism of
every module sheaf, and it commutes with every morphism. Composing that with the
ring map `k → Γ(X, O_X)` supplied by the structure morphism makes every
`Hom`-group a `k`-module, compatibly with composition — that is, it makes
`X.Modules` a `k`-linear category, and `Coh X` with it.

Every ingredient was already here. `Cohomology.globalSectionSmul`,
`globalSectionAction`, `baseFieldToGlobalSections`, `varietyScalarAction` and
`varietyScalarAction_naturality` were built to give coherent cohomology its
`k`-structure; this file observes that the same action makes the *category*
linear, which is a strictly stronger statement and one nothing had recorded.

## Why this is worth its own file

Because of what it unlocks rather than what it says. Mathlib's
`DerivedCategory.Linear` gives `Linear R (DerivedCategory C)` from
`Linear R C`, and `Linear.fullSubcategory` propagates to
`DerivedCategory.Bounded C`, which is a `FullSubcategory` of it. So the single
instance below is the whole distance between "`Hom` in `Dᵇ(Coh X)` is an abelian
group" and "`Hom` in `Dᵇ(Coh X)` is a `k`-vector space".

That was the one obstruction to *stating* what a spherical object is:
`Hom(E, E⟦i⟧) ≅ k` is not expressible against an `AddCommGrp`, and
`Numerical/GrothendieckGroup/MukaiVector.lean`'s docstring names exactly this
gap when it says sphericity of an object needs an `Ext` that layer does not
have.

## What this does not give

Finite-dimensionality. `Linear k` says the `Hom`-groups are `k`-modules, not
that they are finite-dimensional, and nothing here bounds them.
`FiniteDimensionalCohomology` remains supplied data, and the projective case is
issue #332. A `Hom`-group being a `k`-vector space of unknown dimension is
exactly enough to *state* sphericity and not enough to prove anything about it.

Nor does it give a trace, a Serre functor, or any duality. Those need the
finiteness this file does not supply.

## Main results

* `Variety.modulesLinear` — `X.Modules` is `k`-linear.
* `Variety.cohLinear` — `Coh X` is `k`-linear, inherited as a full subcategory.
* `Variety.smul_eq_action_comp` — the scalar action unfolds to precomposition
  with multiplication by the corresponding global function, which is the only
  fact a caller needs in order to compute with it.
* `Variety.derivedLinear` — `Dᵇ(Coh X)` is `k`-linear, so `Hom(E, F⟦i⟧)` is a
  `k`-vector space.

Precomposition rather than postcomposition is an arbitrary choice;
`varietyScalarAction_naturality` says the two agree, and `comp_smul` below is
where that is spent. -/

`smul_comp` is associativity. `comp_smul` is the only clause with content: it
says the action may be moved across a morphism, which is
`varietyScalarAction_naturality`, itself `globalSectionSmul_naturality` — the
statement that multiplication by a global function is central. -/

/-- **Coherent sheaves on a variety form a `k`-linear category**, inherited from
the ambient module sheaves as a full subcategory.

Declared rather than inferred because `Coh` is a `def`, so instance search does
not see the `FullSubcategory` underneath it; the `Preadditive` and `Abelian`
instances next door are stated the same way. -/

/-! ### Propagation to the derived category

Mathlib's `DerivedCategory.instLinear` fires on its own, and the `inferInstance`
below is the whole of it. That was not always true: `Coh.abelian` used to obtain
its `toPreadditive` from the full subcategory's `Abelian` instance rather than
from `Coh.preadditive`, and search could not cross the gap, so this term had to
supply `cohLinear` by hand. Issue #662 closed that by pinning the field in
`CoherentSheaf/Abelian/Basic.lean`; see the docstring there for why the two are
not interchangeable and what keeps them pinned. -/

/-- Regression test for #662, in the shape that found it: search must reach
`cohLinear` from a `Preadditive` argument that arrived via `Abelian`. -/
