# The dual involution on a numerical intersection ring

`(-)^∨` acts on the codimension-`i` part of `A^•(X)_ℚ` by `(-1)^i`. It is what turns
Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch into its bilinear form `χ(E,F) = ∫_X ch(E)^∨ · ch(F) · td(X)`, and
so it is the last piece of Layer A that Bridgeland stability needs: the central charge
factors through `N(X)` modulo the radical of that pairing.

## Why a separate data bundle

`NumericalRingDualData R` is an explicit extension of one selected presentation
`R : NumericalRingData n A`, not a field of every numerical ring and not an independent
bundle with another path back to `R`.
A ring that has no chosen dual needs no placeholder, while two choices can coexist without
instance search selecting between them.

## Main definitions

* `NumericalRingDualData R` — the involution, as data plus the axiom that it acts by
  `(-1)^i` on `piece i`.
* `chDual E` — `ch(E)^∨`, written directly as `Σᵢ (-1)ⁱ chᵢ(E)` rather than as `dual (ch E)`.

## Main results

* `dual_ch` — the two descriptions of `ch(E)^∨` agree.
* `dual_involutive_of_mem_piece` — `(-)^∨` is an involution on each graded piece.

## Deliberately not stated

`dual (dual x) = x` for *arbitrary* `x`, and `degree (dual x) = (-1)^n · degree x`. Both are
true, and both need the graded decomposition of `x` — `NumericalRingData.isInternal` — rather
than just membership in a single piece. Nothing downstream needs them: every consumer here
reaches `dual` through `chComp` and `toddComp`, which are graded by construction, so the
component-wise lemmas suffice. Adding the general versions means importing
`DirectSum.IsInternal` machinery for no current gain.

Geometrically this is `E ↦ E^∨` read through the Chern character: `chᵢ(E^∨) = (-1)ⁱchᵢ(E)`.
It is carried as data because `NumericalRingData` does not expose the graded projections, so
there is nothing to define it *from* at this layer. -/
